## ii. Hero Section

The **Hero Section** serves as the introduction to my portfolio, featuring a brief overview of your skills and experience alongside a professional photo. It is designed using a flexible layout to ensure the content is responsive and looks great across all screen sizes. The design also adapts seamlessly to both dark and light themes, providing a consistent user experience.

### Features

- **Introduction**: The hero section introduces me with a bold headline, stating "Hello, I'm Sinclair," followed by my key professional roles, such as *Software Engineer*, *Digital Solutions Architect*, and *Empowering Industries Through Technology*.
  
- **Call to Action**: There is a prominent **Download Resume** button that links to your resume, encouraging visitors to learn more about your work and qualifications.

- **Social Media Links**: The section includes icons that link to your social media profiles (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter). These icons are interactive, changing color when hovered over.

- **Responsive Design**: The section is fully responsive. On larger screens, the content is displayed in a side-by-side layout, with text on the left and an image on the right. On smaller screens, the layout changes to stack the content vertically for better readability.

- **Image**: Your professional image is placed in a circular container with a *cover* object fit to ensure it fills the container nicely without distortion.

- **Box Shadow**: A subtle box shadow is applied to the hero content, which helps it stand out against both dark and light backgrounds. This ensures a polished look regardless of the websiteâ€™s theme.
